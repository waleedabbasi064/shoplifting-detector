# crowdhuman.yaml - Configuration for CrowdHuman Dataset

# Root path to the dataset (absolute or relative)
path:../datasets/crowdhuman  

# Subdirectories for training, validation, and testing images
# Ultralytics will automatically look for labels in../labels/train derived from these paths
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test  # Optional

# Class Configuration
# For shoplifting detection, we focus on the single 'person' class
nc: 1
names:
  0: person

# Hyperparameter Overrides (Optional but Recommended for Crowds)
# High occlusion requires specific augmentation tuning
hsv_h: 0.015  # Hue augmentation (fraction)
hsv_s: 0.7    # Saturation augmentation
hsv_v: 0.4    # Value (Brightness) augmentation
degrees: 0.0  # Rotation (keep 0 for upright pedestrians)
translate: 0.1 # Translation
scale: 0.5    # Scale gain (critical for detecting small/distant people)
shear: 0.0    # Shear
perspective: 0.0 # Perspective
flipud: 0.0   # Vertical flip (disable for standing people)
fliplr: 0.5   # Horizontal flip
mosaic: 1.0   # Mosaic augmentation (essential for small object context)
mixup: 0.1    # Mixup (keep low to avoid confusion in dense scenes)
